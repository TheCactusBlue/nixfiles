Steps:

1. Add all files to staging
2. Commit with a message.
3. Push the commit.

Try to keep the commit message to one line. Describe why it was done. Write descriptive, specific messages, as opposed to generic, vague messages. Follow the conventional commits commit style. Always use a direct message, as opposed to writing a temp file. DO NOT add an attribution footer.
